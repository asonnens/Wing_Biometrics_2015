This is a repository for with all scripts and data for the paper:
Anne Sonnenschein; David VanderZee; William R. Pitchers; Sudarshan Chari; Ian Dworkin. (2015).An Image Database of **Drosophila melanogaster** Wings for Phenomic and Biometric analysis. GigaScience. http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100141.  
The manuscript is available online (open access) [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100141)

All of the raw data (including images, landmark coordinate files, scripts and BioCat settings) are available on GigaDB. The temporary link is here (http://gigadb.org/dataset/view/id/100141/token/9RIJbfKlm1FQMW2e).


This repository includes

1. [Scripts used for the analyses in the paper.](https://github.com/DworkinLab/Wing_Biometrics_2015/tree/master/scripts)
2. [Landmark data used for  real study.](https://github.com/DworkinLab/Wing_Biometrics_2015/tree/master/data)
3. [Some old tutorials, practice data and run throughs](https://github.com/DworkinLab/Wing_Biometrics_2015/tree/master/Dworkin_machine_learning_in_R_tutorials) with practice data for lda, qda.
4. Maybe some easter eggs..

We have extended readme files on the gigascience database (see above), but some short notes about the files are available [here](https://github.com/DworkinLab/Wing_Biometrics_2015/blob/master/Wing_Biometrics_readme.txt).

This work was funded by a [BEACON](beacon-center.org) funded project to Ian Dworkin to generate a database of images from the wings of *Drosophila melanogaster* to be used for biometric analysis.This material is based in part upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement No. DBI-0939454.
