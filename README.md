This is a repository for a [BEACON](beacon-center.org) funded project to generate a database of images from the wings of *Drosophila melanogaster* to be used for biometric analysis. This work was performed by Anne Sonnenschein & Sudarshan Chari under the mentorship of Dr. Ian Dworkin and in collaboration with Dr. Gerry Dozier and Kaushik Roy at NC A&T. This repository contains scripts, some basic tutorials (for the students doing the project as well as everyone else) as well as landmark data. 
The raw images will be up in a public repository with GigaDB and Gigascience (gigadb.org). 

This repository includes

1. Some tutorials and run throughs with practice data for lda, qda,...
2. The real scripts used for the analyses.
3. Landmark data used for the real study.
4. Maybe some easter eggs..
